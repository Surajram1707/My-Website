  <p><b>"Do not think I am dead and gone. You will hear me from my samadhi and I shall guide you."
--Sri Sai Baba</b></p>
<br>
<p><b>These moving and inspiring words, spoken by Sai Baba, have played their part in ensuring that the Samadhi Mandir (also known as the Sai Baba Temple, although technically it is a shrine rather than temple) is the most important site in Shirdi, and the main focus of Sai worship and devotion. For it is here that we find the samadhi (tomb) of Sai Baba, with the compelling statue above it.</b></p>
<br>
<p><b>For pilgrims to Shirdi, darshan at Baba's tomb is the climax of their visit and the statue above the tomb represents the living, breathing God. As such, it is the focus of all their longings, hopes and desires, and a concrete form to which they can express their love. The statue is admired as an extraordinary andexquisite image, exuding grace and benevolence, and a mysterious vitality. Baba sits relaxed, natural and majestic, gazing benignly on the millions of diverse visitors who flock to him for succour. Many have commented on the life-like quality of the eyes, as these are typically the most difficult feature to portray in a stone sculpture. In this statue, though, they really do seem to be looking at us and responding!</b></p>
<br>
<p><b>Baba repeatedly assured devotees that he would never cease to answer their call even from his tomb, and that his mission is "to give blessings". The pull of the tomb, above which the statue sits, is powerful and intense and draws seekers to Shirdi in numbers that increase every year. Here, devotees address their heartfelt prayers, beg for help, give thanks and offerings for prayers answered and wishes fulfilled, sing their devotion, and pay humble obeisance to their beloved deity. For them, the statue does not merely represent God, it is God; and the opportunity to prostrate before it and make oblations may be the fulfilment of a lifetime's ambition.</b></p>
<br>
<p><b>The statue, which has become such a famous and well-loved image of Baba, was not installed until 1954, and there is an intriguing story behind it. Some white marble arrived from Italy at the Bombay docks, but nobody seemed to know anything about it - who it was for, or why it had come. In the absence of a claimant, the dockyard auctioned it and the purchaser offered it to the Shirdi Sansthan (temple authorities). Impressed by the quality of the marble, they wanted to use it for an image of Baba and gave the commission to a sculptor from Bombay, Balaji Vasant Talim. However, the latter had only one black-and-white photo of Baba to use as his model and was struggling to get the likeness. One night Baba came to him in a dream, remarked on his difficulties and then showed him his face from various angles, encouraging Talim to study it thoroughly and remember it well. This gave Talim the fillip he needed and after that the work flowed easily and the result exceeded all expectations.</b></p>

<p><b>Arati is a form of congregational worship with music and lights, celebrated with particular elan in Maharashtra and especially in Shirdi. Those interested in the history of arati and its evolution in Shirdi are referred to Arati Sai Baba - the Psalm Book of Shirdi Aratis by Sri Sainathuni Sarath Babuji.</b></p>
<br>
<p><b>For many who come to Shirdi, attendance at arati is one of the highlights of their visit. It is perhaps during arati that we can most easily experience the essence of Shirdi and the power of Baba's presence. Some people experience a heightened state and speak of a dissolution of the sense of separation, the erosion of the boundary between self and God. Others say that this is the time when Baba comes "alive" for them and answers their questions and prayers.</b></p>
<br>
<p><b>The effect of the group and its stirring emotion - of faith, longing and devotion - acts powerfully on the heart. The atmosphere becomes highly charged and there is a palpable sense of the numinous. In Baba's time too, it seems that arati was an occasion when his grace was particularly felt and experienced by the devotees. Some of these instances are recorded in Shirdi Diary by G. S. Khaparde who, in his own phlegmatic style, speaks of a particular elation at such times. The impact of the ceremony is intensified by dazzling sensual input: for the eyes there is a dynamic kaleidoscope of colourful images (the fondly adorned statue and samadhi, the waving arati flame, the red and gold uniform of the mace-bearing chopdars); for the ears there are the melodious and passionately rendered songs accompanied by harmonium and other instruments - not to mention the thrilling cries of praise at the end; and for fragrance there is the aroma of incense, rose-water and numerous flower offerings.</b></p>
