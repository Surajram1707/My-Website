    <p><b>Lendi is significant as the place which Baba used to visit every day. It contains some tombs, a shrine, and most importantly, the perpetually burning lamp lit by Baba and placed between the two trees he planted.</b></p>
    <br>

    <br>
    <p><b>This is the main feature of Lendi: the perpetually burning lamp between two trees that Baba is said to have planted, a neem and a bodhi. As the trees were touched by Baba and planted close to where he sat and the lamp that he lit, the area serves as a focus for worship, including pradakshina.</b></p>
<br>
<p><b>Between the neem tree and the bodhi tree is Nanda Deep ("lamp of bliss", also known as Akhanda Deep - "perpetually burning lamp"), the lamp that was originally lit by Baba. Later, Baba instructed Abdul Baba to see that it was kept burning.</b></p>
<br>
<p><b>The lamp as we see it now was built by the Sansthan and the area has been paved. In Baba's time the lamp was sunk into a small pit and protected from the wind by some zinc sheets and later some pieces of cloth, making a kind of tent with the lamp in the centre.</b></p>
<br>
<p><b>Nanda Deep was a place where Baba liked to sit in contemplation. Abdul Baba says that Baba would sit on the ground close to the lamp, but not in a place from where he could actually see the lamp. It seems, therefore, that Baba was not using this lamp for its light or flame (since it was covered). Just as the lamp itself was concealed, exactly what Baba was doing here is also veiled from us.</b></p>
