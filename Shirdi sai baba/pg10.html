  <h2>IF YOU LOOK TO ME , I LOOK TO YOU</h2>
  <h2>WHY FEAR WHEN I AM HERE</h2>
  <h1><u>My Experience of  Miracles</u></h1>
  <p><b>I am Surajram from Chennai,India.I am a staunch devotee of Shri Shirdi Sai baba and Shri Sathya Sai baba since my childhood.
    The more faith you have on deva,the more attached you feel to Him and the more you feel His presence near you. Sharddha aur Saburi are the best principles of Sai baba.
    If you earnestly follow these principles you are sure to achieve what you want.
I am sharing a miracle that I experienced when I was in class four.
When I was in class 4,I was affected by Leptospirosis. It is a very serious fever that is caused due to the virus present in rat's urine.
I am alive today because of Sai Baba.
That fever has a very serious symptomps of redding of eyes,and even losing consciousness.I was very sick for more than a week with extremely high fever.
That time at home we only had a statue of Sai Baba made of fibre that we bought for Navratri.The statue is very powerful and I flet the presence of Sai Baba in that statue.
Before leaving to the hospital my mom kept the statue on my head praying for my wellness. I was taken to the hospital to be admitted but  the treatment given in the first hospital couldnot cure me.
So with great difficulty it was plannned that  I will be moved to another hospital but that hospital refused as they did not have enough beds.But the doctor suggested that he would treat me in a different hospital.
So I was moved to that hospital.But to everyone's surprise and astonishment,the name of the hospital was Shri Sai Nath Hospital.
This was indeed a miracle and I was cured on the next day itself but I had to stay in the hospital for treatment for the next few days.
Then I was cured within the next few days.</b></p>
<br>
<p><b>Another amazing miracle that I wish to share with you all was the blessing with Udi from Shri Sai baba's photo.
  We regularly visit the Sai baba temple at Jaishankar street,Westmambalam.Every year we would get a calendar for every new year.
  We had hung a calendar along with Baba's picture in our room. We had stuck tapes on all four sides of the picture.
  One day while we removed the tapes to frame the picture ,to our astonishment,we found Udi that was present on the wall and on the back side of the picture.<b><p>
