  <p><b>Before Sai Baba arrived in Shirdi, Dwarkamai was an old mosque in a dilapidated condition. Baba turned it into Dwarkamai and proved that there is only one God. Dwarkamai comprises a portrait of Baba and a big Shila or stone tablet where Baba would often sit. Another remarkable feature of this mosque is the perpetual Dhuni or fire that was lit by Baba when he was alive. The ash from the burnt wood from this Dhuni is divine and sacred, and it can cure any illness of Baba’s devotees and visitors. In another portion of Dwarkamai is a square stool made of stone, which Baba used for taking a bath. The primary attraction of this place is an oil painting of Sai Baba. There is also a grinding stone and a wooden vessel called Kolamba in which Baba used to keep the alms brought from the village. Baba would lovingly call Dwarkamai as his mother because he would feel contented and blissful when seated here.</b></p>
  <p><b>In a mosque at Shirdi, Shri Sai spent most of His time. He named it as Dwarakamai masjid. The very nomenclature shows that Shri Sai wanted social cohesion between two faiths {Hindus and Muslims}. The period of Shri Sai had socio-religious disharmony which started due to prosylytizing efforts by the existing Nizam Sahi rulers. Shri Sai attempted to bring social harmony by emphasising the oneness of Supreme God on Sufi Tradition. The Dwarakamai masjid where Baba used to bless visitors and devotees has a special place in Shirdi. Baba said “The wretched and miserable would rise into plenty of joy and happiness, as soon as they climb the steps of my mosque. Even now steps of mosque are the beginning of the end of problems for the visitors and devotees.</b></p>
